# Q1.
A processor has 40 distinct instruction and 24 general purpose register. A 32 bit instruction has an OPCode, 2 register OPCodes, and an immediate operand. What is the number of bit available for the immediate operand filed. 

**Ans.**

# ChatGPT Ans. and Logic
## **Step 1: Understand the question**

We have:

- **Instruction length** = 32 bits total.
    
- Fields inside the instruction:
    
    1. **Opcode** → tells CPU which instruction to execute.
        
    2. **2 register opcodes** → each specifies one register out of 24 GPRs.
        
    3. **Immediate operand** → actual constant value.
        

We need:  
**Number of bits for the immediate operand** = total instruction bits − (bits for opcode + bits for register fields).

---

## **Step 2: Bits needed for the opcode**

We have **40 distinct instructions**.

- Number of bits needed = smallest $n$ such that $2^n \geq 40$.
    

Let’s calculate:

- $2^5 = 32$ → not enough.
    
- $2^6 = 64$ → enough.
    

✅ **Opcode size** = **6 bits**.

---

## **Step 3: Bits needed for each register opcode**

We have **24 registers**.

- Number of bits needed = smallest $n$ such that $2^n \geq 24$.
    

Let’s calculate:

- $2^4 = 16$ → not enough.
    
- $2^5 = 32$ → enough.
    

✅ **Register field size** = **5 bits** (per register).

---

## **Step 4: Bits for both register opcodes**

We have **2 registers** in the instruction:

- Total = $5 + 5 = 10$ bits.
    

---

## **Step 5: Remaining bits for immediate operand**

Total instruction size = 32 bits.

$\text{Immediate bits} = 32 - (\text{opcode bits} + \text{2 register bits})$
Substitute:

$\text{Immediate bits} = 32 - (6 + 10) = 32 - 16 = 16$

✅ **Immediate operand field** = **16 bits**.

---

### **Final Answer**

**16 bits are available for the immediate operand.**

---
## Reason?

Exactly — the “smallest power of 2 just greater than 40” part is the **core reason** behind why the opcode needs 6 bits.  
Let me unpack it thoroughly, because this comes up _all the time_ in COA.

---

## **Why power of 2?**

Computers store data in **binary** — every bit can only be **0** or **1**.  
So if you have:

- **1 bit** → $2^1 = 2$ possible patterns.
    
- **2 bits** → $2^2 = 4$ possible patterns.
    
- **3 bits** → $2^3 = 8$ possible patterns.
    
- and so on…
    

The total **unique codes** you can represent with $n$ bits = $2^n$.

---

## **Why pick the smallest power of 2 ≥ number of items?**

Because we must have enough **unique binary patterns** to represent every possible value.

Example for opcode:

- We have **40 distinct instructions** → need 40 unique binary patterns.
    
- $2^5 = 32$ → can represent only 32 unique codes → not enough.
    
- $2^6 = 64$ → can represent 64 unique codes → **enough**.  
    (Some of those 64 codes might be unused, but we can’t go smaller without losing the ability to encode all instructions.)
    

This is exactly why:

$\text{Number of bits} = \lceil \log_2(\text{Number of items}) \rceil$

Here:

$\lceil \log_2(40) \rceil = \lceil 5.32... \rceil = 6$

---

## **Same logic for registers**

- **24 registers** → need unique patterns for each register number.
    
- $2^4 = 16$ → not enough (only 16 registers possible).
    
- $2^5 = 32$ → enough (can label up to 32 registers).
    
- Bits required = $\lceil \log_2(24) \rceil = 5$.
    

---

💡 **Key takeaway:**  
The **bit size** of a field = the smallest integer number of bits that can cover all possible values in that field, which means rounding **up** to the next power of 2 if the exact number isn’t a power of 2.

# Q2. 
It is a system which support only 2-address instruction each with 16 bit. If address length is 6 bit then maximum and minimum how many instruction that system can support.

# Q3.
Consider a system with 32 bit length instruction which is one address and 8 different addressing mode. Find out the minimum and maximum number of instruction if the system has 4mb of memory size.
