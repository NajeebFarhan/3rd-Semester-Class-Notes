# Instruction field
The most common fields are 
1. **Operation field** specifies the operation to be perform like addition, subtraction.
2. **Address field** which contains the location of the operand that is registered. 
3. **Mode field** which specifies how operand to be founded.

An instruction if of variable length depending upon the number of addresses if contains generally CPU organisation is of 3 types:
4. **Single accumulator organization:** In this organization the operation is performed using a special register called accumulator.
5. **General register organization:** In general register organization multiple register are used for the computation purpose.
6. **Stack organization:** In this organization the work on stack basic operation due to which it doesn't contain any address field.
