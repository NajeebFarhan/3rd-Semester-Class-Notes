# Instruction field
The most common fields are 
1. Operation field specifies the operation to be perform like addition, subtraction.
2. Address field which contains location of the operands that is resistors or memory location.
3. Node field which specifies how operand to be founded.

If instruction is of variable length depending upon the number of addresses it contains. Generally CPU organization of three types
1. Single accumulator organization: In this organization the operation is performed using a special resistor called accumulator.
2. General resistor organization: In general resistor organization multiple resistor are used for the computation purpose.
3. Stack organization: In this organization the work on stack basis operation due to which it doesn't contain any address field.
