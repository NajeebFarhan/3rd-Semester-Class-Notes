This instruction does not specify any operand or address instead they operate on data stored in register or memory location implicitly define by the instruction. For e.g. A 0-Address instruction simply add the contents of two register together without specifying the register name

A stack based computer does not use the address field of the instruction. To evaluate an expression it first converted into reverse place notation that is post fix notation.
