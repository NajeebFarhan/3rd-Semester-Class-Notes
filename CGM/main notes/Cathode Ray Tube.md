- **Cathode Ray Tube** is like a specialized vacuum tubes in which images are produced.
- When the electron beam strikes the phosphor coated screen we are able to see the images on the screen, image on the video monitor.
- Cathode Ray Tube is used for modulate, accelerate and deflects the electron beam onto the screen to create an image.

## Main components of Cathode
1. Electron gun -
	1. The electron gun consists of heating filament as well as the cathode
	2. the electron gun generated the negatively changed electron and accelerate it towards the PC screen with the help of heating filament

2. Heating filament -
	1. This is like a tiny electric heater when electricity passes through it heats up.
	2. It is a slower and costlier component
