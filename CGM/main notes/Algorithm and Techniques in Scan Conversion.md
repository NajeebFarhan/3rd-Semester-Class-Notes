The advantage of the scan conversion algorithm is
1. Algorithm can generate graphics objects at a faster rate.
2. Using algorithm memory can be used efficiently.
3. Algorithms can develop a higher level of graphical objects.

**Types of scan conversion techniques**
1. **DDA(Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm**
	DDA is step-by-step method to draw a line by incrementing x or y by small amounts and calculating the corresponding y or x value. 

2. Bresenham's Algorithm
	1. Line
	2. circle
3. Mid-point algorithm 
	1. line
	2. Circle
4. Polygon Filling Algorithm
