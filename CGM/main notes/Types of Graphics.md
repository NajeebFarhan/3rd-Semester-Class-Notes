# Types of Graphics
In representing pixels in CG can be represented in two main ways
1. **Raster graphics(Bit map images)**
	- Raster graphics composed of grids of tiny squares called as pixels.
	- This images are resolution dependent meaning they lose quality when scaled up.
	- Commonly used in photography, digital printing, game graphics, web images.
	- Raster graphics are ideal for complex images with many colors and details.
	- They require large file sizes for high resolution images.
	- File formats are .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif

2. **Vector graphics**
	- Are created using mathematical formulas to represent shapes like line, curves and polygons.
	- They don't use pixels so, they can be scaled up to any size without loosing quality.
	- Ideal for images that require scaling such as icons and technical drawings..
	- They are resolution independent i.e. same quality in any size.
	- Vector graphics used less memory compared to high resolution raster images.
	- Editing Vector graphics is easier because shapes can be individually move, resized, or modified.
	- Commonly used in CAD application, illustration and printing industry.
	- Files format used are .svg, .ai(adobe illustrator), .eps
