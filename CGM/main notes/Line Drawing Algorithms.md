a **line drawing algorithm** is a step by step method used by the computer to figure out which pixels to light up so that it looks like a straight line.

our computer screen are grids of pixels like a graph paper but a straight line between two points may not go perfectly through the centers of pixels. so the algorithms chooses the best nearby pixels that makes the line look as straight as possible
